# Arifu
This is a repository of my analysis during Arifu. It involves code for pulling and manipulating datasets. Additionally, cleaning the profiles data, generating completion rate for each program and learner. The repo contains two folders 
Library - contains a file for the library i am developing for automation of internal analysis
Notebooks - contains file(s) used for analysis for different projects
This repository is mostly for storage purposes but if it provides any value to you, feel free to utilize some of the codes. Thanks!
